# Serverless Inspector Tool - Self-test Repository
Repository used by the [Serverless Inspector Tool](https://github.com/giusepperaffa/serverless-inspector-tool) in **infrastructure** code self-test mode.

It contains a collection of Python files developed to test the [infrastructure code CodeQL queries](https://github.com/giusepperaffa/serverless-inspector-tool/tree/main/codeql/infrastructure) included in the Serverless Inspector Tool.

Since the Python files were generated out of YAML files, these are also included in the folder [yaml](yaml).
