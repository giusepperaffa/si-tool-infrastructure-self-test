# Serverless Inspector Tool - Self-test Repository
Repository used by the Serverless Inspector Tool in **infrastructure** code self-test mode.

It contains a collection of Python files developed to test the infrastructure code CodeQL queries included in the Serverless Inspector Tool.

Since the Python files were generated out of YAML files, these are also included in the folder yaml.
